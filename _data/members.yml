  bio: Rachael Ainsworth is currently a Research Associate in Radio Astronomy and Open Science Champion at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester, UK. She observes jets from young stars with next-generation radio telescopes to investigate the physical processes that assemble stars like our Sun. She is an Open Project Lead in the Round 4 Cohort of Mozilla Open Leaders (<a href="https://twitter.com/rachaelevelyn/lists/rebelfoxes">#RebelFoxes</a>ðŸ¦Š), working on a project to develop an open science how-to kit for astronomers to open up their research workflow from proposal to publication. She also organizes a chapter of HER+Data in Manchester (<a href="https://twitter.com/herplusdatamcr">@herplusdatamcr</a>), a meetup group to bring together women who work with and love data - to support one another, inspire each other, share experiences and talk data. HER+Data MCR allows her to bridge the gap between academia and industry by connecting women across STEM fields. She interested in community building and engagement, promoting openness, inclusivity and well-being in science and technology.

  bio: David is a PhD student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. David earned a Masterâ€™s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham Young University where he fabricated and characterized thin-films and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, David studied theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems using neural networks at Westminster College. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program, and one of the lead developers on PyMKS materials informatics toolkit.

  bio: Dr. Kalidindiâ€™s research interests are broadly centered on designing material internal structure (including composition) for optimal performance in any selected application and identifying hybrid processing routes for its manufacture. To this end, he has employed a harmonious blend of experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches in his research.
